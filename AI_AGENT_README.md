## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **React Component**: `AIAgent.tsx` - Main AI assistant component
- **Command Parser**: `commandParser.ts` - Natural language processing
- **Speech API**: Web Speech API for voice recognition and synthesis
- **State Management**: Integrates with existing store context

### Key Components

1. **AIAgent**: Main component with voice/text input handling
2. **CommandParser**: Parses natural language into executable commands
3. **Speech Recognition**: Handles voice input
4. **Speech Synthesis**: Provides audio feedback
5. **Command Execution**: Routes commands to appropriate actions

### Browser Compatibility

- **Voice Recognition**: Chrome, Edge, Safari (webkit)
- **Text Input**: All modern browsers
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Customization

### Adding New Commands

To add new command types, modify the `CommandParser` class in `src/lib/commandParser.ts`:

```typescript
// Add new command type
private static newCommandKeywords = ['keyword1', 'keyword2'];

// Add parsing logic
private static parseNewCommand(input: string, words: string[]): Command | null {
  // Implementation
}

// Add to main parse method
const newCommand = this.parseNewCommand(lowerInput, words);
if (newCommand) {
  return { command: newCommand, originalText: input };
}
```

### Modifying Responses

Update the `executeCommand` function in `AIAgent.tsx` to handle new command types:

```typescript
case 'newCommand':
  // Handle new command type
  break;
```

### Styling

The AI agent uses Tailwind CSS classes and can be customized by modifying the className props in the component.
